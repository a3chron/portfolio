# Explanation, a "why?" answered

*Someone* was complaining about the Webshop *he or she* uses, 
so *someone else* (also IT) decided to develop a new, better Webshop for *him or her*.

After three years of solo development, *he or she* was cut of by *him or her*, 
because it took to long.

Now i started developing a new WebShop for *him or her*, because of further complaints, 
and it took only two years yet...

i am *almost* done ;)

# Quick Description

PyShop is a simple, efficient but also powerful WebShop for small Companies and Individuals.

And, big suprise, i am still working on it...
