Another project I am still thinking about, because there are a few,
but I could try to improve UI/UX (hopefully)

It would be an app where you could create workflows/actions for GitHub,
for example an prettier & lint check and the following deployment.

I'll maybe add some kind of GitHub integration later to visualize workflows while running...
