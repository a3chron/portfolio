# The Story begins

I began with this app, because I reorganized my working place. 
While doing so, I found a few plants, that gave my room a nice touch. 

But as I am not very good with plants, I searched for a app, that would help me with them, 
e.g. tell me when to water them, how often, the amount of water, and so on...
Also it should remind me to water them. I searched and searched, but all (free) apps that I found,
were full with ads, nearly unuseable.

And so I decided to develop my own little App, that would help me (and maybe others) with such things.

I am currently still working on it, because I thought: "when doing this, let's do it good". (Big mistake)


# More detailed description

Plant Organizer is a online App, that reminds you, when to water your plants, and makes it easy to manage them.
The user get's a suggestion for watering time and amount, but it can be adjusted by the user.

If a (so far experimental) feature is enabled by the user, the suggestion also improves itself, 
according to the health of other user's plants, that have a slightly different watering amount and/or time, 
but a healthier plant.


# Api (Docs)

As I am a developer, of course I added an API to my Website (and the Docs)

Well, it's all a little buggy right now, but I certainly hope that the app will become a good ally 
when fighting the death rates of home plants soon.

With the App working, it will be possible to get basic information on plants, 
or fetch watering suggestions (for example for little home projects, etc.) with the API.
