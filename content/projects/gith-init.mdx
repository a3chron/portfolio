While working at [gith](https://github.com/a3chron/gith), a TUI git helper, 
I had to add a check whether the command is run in a valid git repo.

If not it advises to run `git init`, or change the directory.
There I tought, I might create a TUI, that helps all of the automated setup coming after `git init`,
which is usually just searching for a command and installing it, to set the repo up for some specific framework.
