# Starship

[Startship](https://starship.rs/) is a "cross-shell prompt", a cool way to customize the look of your shell, 
but also good to add some helpful information, for example the current git branch, Node or Python version, and much more...

## Installation

Starship is aviable for many operating systems:

- Android
- BSD
- Linux
- macOS
- Windows

and even more shells:

- Bash
- Cmd
- Elvish
- Fish
- Ion
- Nushell
- PowerShell
- Tcsh
- Xonsh
- Zsh

The installation-guide for these can be found at: 
[Installation](https://starship.rs/guide/#%F0%9F%9A%80-installation)

If you can't find yourself at this list, check out the [Advanced Installation](https://starship.rs/installing/#advanced-installation).

As the Installation Guide is quite good, I will only show the guides for Linux and MacOS.

For any other installation options, or shell, please check the [Starship Installation Guide](https://starship.rs/guide/#%F0%9F%9A%80-installation)

1. Install Starship

```bash title="Linux"
curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
```

```zsh title="MacOS"
# same as linux, or:
brew install starship
```

2. Configure the shell to start Starship

Add these lines to your shell's configuration file:

| shell | location                   | command |
|-------|----------------------------|---------|
| bash  | ~/.bashrc                  | eval "$(starship init bash)" |
| fish  | ~/.config/fish/config.fish | starship init fish | source |
| zsh   | ~/.zshrc                   | eval "$(starship init zsh)" |
| Elvish| ~/.elvish/rc.elv           | eval (starship init elvish) |
| Ion   | ~/.config/ion/initrc       | eval $(starship init ion) |

3. Configure Starship

When you open a new shell, you should see the new prompt.

For customization, check out the [Starship Config](https://starship.rs/config/) information.

To get started configuring starship, create the following file: 

`~/.config/starship.toml`

> For more information about TOML, see their [Github Repo](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml)
