# Story

Well, i started with this, because all my other projects, 
that were meant to be (also) a good project for my portfolio website
happened to become bigger and bigger, and take longer and longer.

So, after a few years of developing a few apps, which had no end,
i decided to develop something real quick: "DevApps".
>(one evening -> 3-5h -> real quick)

I made a collection of my favourite apps, frameworks and APIs,
that may help other developers finding something interesting.

Currently there are mostly apps, that could help Web-Developers,
but i plan on adding a few more apps, maybe more diverse.

Also many cool features are on the way... 

If you know any wonderful App/etc. that is not on my Website, 
feel free to make a [App Request](https://github.com/kurtschambach/DevApps/issues/new?assignees=kurtschambach&labels=app-request&projects=&template=app_request.yaml&title=APP+REQUEST%3A+).

(I mean it would be real great, and it would help me improve my app :) )
