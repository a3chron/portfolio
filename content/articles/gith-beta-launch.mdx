# Gith Beta Launch

I had exams, so I obviously started building something instead of studying. 
Gith is the result, and one I am quite proud of, 
as it can be a small life-improvement, even in it's beta phase, and with a few features missing.  
Because of this I launched a beta release on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/gith?launch=gith-beta),
just to get some more early on feedback.  
In other words, feel free to comment any ideas for features you would like to see in the first stable release on Product Hunt, 
or create / upvote feature requests and bugs on [Featurebase](https://gith.featurebase.app/).

## Key features

Gith aims to support the most common git commands, packaged in a sleek, user-friendly interface.
For some of the git commands, there are even some little quality-of-life improvements, for example when adding new tags:

Usually, you'd run `git tag <exact-tag>` but with gith you just run `gith add tag`,
which starts its interactive mode. 
Gith automatically finds the latest tag and suggests new tags for patch, minor, and major updates, 
from which you can choose.

Gith tries to use intuitive, 
natural language commands, such as "add tag", "push tag", "add remote" etc.

## Who it's for

Gith helps both beginners getting started with Git through its user-friendly interface, 
and experienced users by making everyday tasks easier.

## Opensource

Gith is opensource, so feel free to check out the code at [github](https://github.com/a3chron/gith/)

**Enjoy, and don't forget to give feedback ;)**
