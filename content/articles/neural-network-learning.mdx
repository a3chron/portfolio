# Basics of Neural Networks and Deep Learning - Part 4

> Course Overview: [Deep Learning Course - Overview](/blog/deep-learning-course)

We will *learn* how Neural Networks are *learning*.

## Content of this "block"
The **marked** article is the current one.

- Our Brain and the Perceptron
- MNIST, and why good data is so important
- Structure of a Neural Network
- **A Neural Network is learning**
- Backpropagation

## How is a Neural Network learning?

Well, there are a few possible ways.
We'll look at a few of them:

### Supervised Learning

*used in our first project*

For classification.

The NN gets data entry, and the corrseponding label.

### Unsupervised Learning

NN gets data. Structure and Cluster/Muster in the data finding, and get rule.

### Reinforecement Learning

No data, but all tries in a simulated environment are rated.


## How are we rating out Neural Network

We want to calculate the error.

Costfuction/errorfunction

e.g. `<calculated solution> - <right solution>`

by squaring the result, errors are punished more severely
