# Introduction

First of all, let me introduce myself: My name is Kurt, 
I am a young (18 this year) software developer located near Munich, 
and I'm now working ca. one year at [Titanom Technologies](https://titanom.com/).

It's a cool StartUp, working on AI-Solutions for the education in Germany. 
I learned much here, for example two new programming languages in the first few months
(I used Python before, now mostly TypeScript), some frameworks and much more...

# New Portfolio

Well, I had a portfolio, but a friend from work said that the design could be better, 
so I changed everything ;)

The theme is inspired by [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) (the superuser theme), 
but I also added a few of my own colors.

I have a [theme](/theme) section here, but currently there are only the colors I use.
I will add more soon.

You can check out the code at GitHub: [Portfolio](https://github.com/kurtschambach/portfolio).
As I have written in the README too, I am aware of the code not being the best, but I will refactor it in the near future (hopefully).

# My Apps

I am currently working on a few apps, but if you want to try a little one, 
that I already "finished" (it will never be finished, but it's useable), 
check out [DevApps](https://dev-apps.vercel.app/).

It's a little collection of apps, that can be useable for Devs, 
currently maybe many Web related Apps, like Next.js or Vercel, but I will add some more apps with time.

For more information about DevApps, you can read the [project description](/projects/dev-apps).
