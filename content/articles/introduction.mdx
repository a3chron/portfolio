# Introduction

First, a little introduction of me: My name is Kurt, 
i am a young (18 this year) software developer near munich, 
and im now working ca. one year at [Titanom Technologies](https://titanom.com/).

It's a cool StartUp, working on AI-Solutions for the education in germany. 
I learned much here, for example two new programming languages in the first few months
(i used python before, now mostly TypeScript), a few frameworks and much more...

# New portfolio

Well, i had a portfolio, but a friend from work said that the design is not the best, 
so i changed everything ;)

For the theme, i took [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) as an exmaple (the superuser theme), 
but i also added a few of my own colors.

I have a [theme](/theme) section here, but currently there are only the colors i used.
I will add something more with time.

You can check out the code at GitHub: [Portfolio](https://github.com/kurtschambach/portfolio).
As I've written in the README too, the code is not the best, i will refactor it in the near future (hopefully).

# My Apps

I am currently working on a few apps, but if you want to try a little one, 
that i already "finished" (it will never be finished, but it's useable), 
check out [DevApps](https://dev-apps.vercel.app/).

It's a little collection of apps, that could be useable for Devs, 
currently maybe more Web-Developer, but i will add some more apps with time.

For more information about DevApps, you can read the [project description](/projects/dev-apps).
