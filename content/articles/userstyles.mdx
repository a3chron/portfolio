# Userstyles

## How to use

To use userstyles, you'll have to install the [Stylus Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)
In case you're using something chrome-based, the [Chrome Extensions](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne).

After installing the browser extension, you have several ways to use userstyles.  
First of all, there is the [userstyles.world](https://userstyles.world/) page, where you can search for page, you want styles for.

Another great resource is the [official catppuccin userstyles repo](https://github.com/catppuccin/userstyles/), 
a must-visit, if you are into catppuccin.

And for some people [my custom catppuccin userstyles](https://userstyles.world/user/kurtschambach) may be interesting too.

The last option is obviously, start coding your own custom userstyles :)
