# Ubuntu Customization

Basically my call on "How to make Ubuntu look goodâ„¢".

I recently discovered [catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com), 
so it'll be mostly this.

Scope:
- GTK Theme
- Cursor Theme
- Icon Theme
- Fish Shell
- Some Gnome extensions
- Some catppuccin themes for various apps
- Starship

## Update packages

We will need a few new packages, so make sure you are up to date:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

## Tweaks

First we'll need to install gnome-tweaks, 
a tool to customize a few important settings.

```bash
sudo apt install gnome-tweaks
```

## GTK Theme

This is just an overall catppuccin style theme replacing the default GTK theme.

Download the `Catppuccin-Dark-B-LB.zip` (Mocha, Dark, Border, Legacy Buttons)
from the **Files tab** at [gnome-look.org](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1715554).

Create a directory for all your themes at `~/.themes`, 
and move your downloaded folder there.

Now add a symlink from you gtk files (usually located at `~/.config/gtk-4.0`), 
to the respecting files in your themes directory.

There should be a `assets` folder, and `gtk.css`, and `gtk-dark.css` files.

You can create symlinks using the following command (replace 'username'):

```bash title="~/.config/gtk-4.0"
ln -sf /home/username/.themes/Catppuccin-Dark-Macchiato-B-LB/Catppuccin-Dark-Macchiato/gtk-4.0/assets/ ./assets/
```


## Cursor Theme

Now we will install a new Cursor Theme.  
Download the files at [gnome look](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1358330/)

You shoud now have `01-Vimix-cursors.tar.xz` in your Downloads.
Extract it, and copy the `dist` directory to `/usr/share/icons/vimix`.  
Optionally you can also copy `dist-white` to `/usr/share/icons/vimix-white`.

```bash
sudo mv dist "/usr/share/icons/vimix"
sudo mv dist-white "/usr/share/icons/vimix-white"
```

You can now set the cursor theme in Tweaks/Appearance -> Cursor, just search for vimix.


## Icon Theme

Here we will download a Icon Theme, to replace the default ubuntu one.
IF you like others more, you can use these too, [Papirus]() for example is a quite common one.

We will use [Flat-Remix](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1214931) here.

After downloading, you should have `01-Flat-Remix-GTK-Blue-20240730.tar.xz` in your Downloads.

Extract it, and move the `Flat-Remix-Blue-Dark` directory to `~/.local/share/icons`.

```bash
mv "Flat-Remix-Blue-Dark" ~/.local/share/icons
```

You can now set the icon theme in Tweaks/Appearance -> Icons.


## Fish Shell

This improvement is more about efficiency than looking good.  

If you are not already using fish, you can install it by running:
```bash
sudo apt install fish
```

More info about fish: https://fishshell.com/

Now just run `fish` in the terminal, and try out the auto-completion 
and other features of fish, like improved reverse-search (Ctrl + R).


## Some Gnome extensions

![](/blog-images/user-extensions.png)

Gnome extensions are just small but very useful extensions for your Desktop.

To install the extension manager run:
```bash
sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-manager
```

You can search and view extension at [extensions.gnome](https://extensions.gnome.org/),
and install them in the extension manager.

Optionally, to install extensions right away from the browser, 
install the [gnome shell firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gnome-shell-integration/),
and run:
```bash
sudo apt install gnome-browser-connector
```

Now you can use the install button at a extensions page.

## Some catppuccin themes for various apps

There are catppuccin themes for many apps, 
you can view all ports at their [official site](https://catppuccin.com/ports/).

Search for any relevant apps, and follow their installation instructions.

One of the bigger ports are userstyles, I have a seperate article on them: [Userstyles](/blog/userstyles)


## Starship

Starship is another improvement for your terminal.

I have a older articel on [Starship](/blog/starship) which covers installation and configuration, 
with my old and current configuration file at the end.  
You can copy the new one, for a catppuccin theme in your terminal, and configure it further if you want.
