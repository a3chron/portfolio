# Ubuntu Customization

Basically my call on "How to make Ubuntu look good"â„¢.

I recently discovered [catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com), 
so it'll be mostly this.

Scope:
- GTK Theme
- Cursor Theme
- Icon Theme
- Fish Shell
- Some Gnome extensions
- Some catppuccin themes for various apps
- Starship

## Update packages

We will need a few new packages, so make sure you are up to date:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

## Tweaks

First we'll need to install gnome-tweaks, 
a tool to customize a few important settings.

```bash
sudo apt install gnome-tweaks
```

## GTK Theme

This is just an overall catppuccin style theme replacing the default GTK theme.

Download the `Catppuccin-Dark-B-LB.zip` (Mocha, Dark, Border, Legacy Buttons)
from the **Files tab** at [gnome-look.org](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1715554).

Create a directory for all your themes at `~/.themes`, 
and move your downloaded folder there.

Now add a symlink from you gtk files (usually located at `~/.config/gtk-4.0`), 
to the respecting files in your themes directory.

There should be a `assets` folder, and `gtk.css`, and `gtk-dark.css` files.

You can create symlinks using the following command (replace 'username'):

```bash title="~/.config/gtk-4.0"
ln -sf /home/username/.themes/Catppuccin-Dark-Macchiato-B-LB/Catppuccin-Dark-Macchiato/gtk-4.0/assets/ ./assets/
```


## Cursor Theme

Now we will install a new Cursor Theme.  
Download the files at [gnome look](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1358330/)

You shoud now have `01-Vimix-cursors.tar.xz` in your Downloads.
Extract it, and copy the `dist` directory to `/usr/share/icons/vimix`.  
Optionally you can also copy `dist-white` to `/usr/share/icons/vimix-white`.

```bash
sudo mv dist "/usr/share/icons/vimix"
sudo mv dist-white "/usr/share/icons/vimix-white"
```

You can now set the cursor theme in Tweaks/Appearance -> Cursor, just search for vimix.


## Icon Theme

Here we will download a Icon Theme, to replace the default ubuntu one.
IF you like others more, you can use these too, [Papirus]() for example is a quite common one.

We will use [Flat-Remix](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1214931) here.

After downloading, you should have `01-Flat-Remix-GTK-Blue-20240730.tar.xz` in your Downloads.

Extract it, and move the `Flat-Remix-Blue-Dark` directory to `~/.local/share/icons`.

```bash
mv "Flat-Remix-Blue-Dark" ~/.local/share/icons
```

You can now set the icon theme in Tweaks/Appearance -> Icons.


## Fish Shell

This improvement is more about efficiency than looking good.  

If you are not already using fish, you can install it by running:
```bash
sudo apt install fish
```

More info about fish: https://fishshell.com/

Now just run `fish` in the terminal, and try out the auto-completion 
and other features of fish, like improved reverse-search (Ctrl + R).


## Some Gnome extensions

![](/blog-images/user-extensions.png)

"Blur my Shell" and "Rounded Window Corners Reborn" are the most important here for the look and feel.

Gnome extensions are just small but very useful extensions for your Desktop.

To install the extension manager run:
```bash
sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-manager
```

You can search and view extension at [extensions.gnome](https://extensions.gnome.org/),
and install them in the extension manager.

Optionally, to install extensions right away from the browser, 
install the [gnome shell firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gnome-shell-integration/),
and run:
```bash
sudo apt install gnome-browser-connector
```

Now you can use the install button at an extensions page.

## Some catppuccin themes for various apps

There are catppuccin themes for many apps, 
you can view all ports at their [official site](https://catppuccin.com/ports/).

Search for any relevant apps, and follow their installation instructions.

One of the bigger ports are userstyles, I have a seperate article on them: [Userstyles](/blog/userstyles)


## Starship

Starship is another improvement for your terminal.

I have a older articel on [Starship](/blog/starship) which covers installation and configuration, 
with a few versions of my configuration file at the end.  
You can copy the one you like most, and configure it further if you want.


## Custom window close buttons

For this one you'll need to me just a little bit more tech-savy.  
You will need to directly customize your current `gtk.css` file.

If you followed this tutorial, the gtk file at `~/.config/gtk4.0/gtk.css` 
should link to your themes `gtk.css` file, so you'll need to edit the themes `gtk.css` file.

> [WARNING] This is "beta"
> I am planning on turning this one into an extension, so it is easier and safer to use. I'll link it here when I'm done.
> 
> No warranty for this file, you can probably break your setup (mostly some things will start look really bad if somethings goes wrong)
> by doing changes in `gtk.css`.  
> I did not test this yet on other devices than mine, and I am not 100% sure which changes were new etc.  
> I'm working on it, but if you want to take the risk, feel free to take a look at the changes I think are neccassary for custom window buttons.  
> I would suggest making sure you can somehow revert it to the original version.
> 
> In the worst case, you should always be able to reinstall the whole theme.
