# Ubuntu Customization

Basically my call on "How to make Ubuntu look goodâ„¢".

I recently discovered [catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com), 
so it'll be mostly this.

Scope:
- GTK Theme
- Cursor Theme
- Icon Theme
- Fish Shell
- Some Gnome extensions
- Some catppuccin themes for various apps
- Starship

## Tweaks

First we'll need to install gnome-tweaks, 
a tool to customize a few important settings.

```bash
sudo apt install gnome-tweaks
```

## GTK Theme

This is just an overall catppuccin style theme replacing the default GTK theme.

Download the `Catppuccin-Dark-B-LB.zip` (Mocha, Dark, Border, Legacy Buttons)
from the **Files tab** at [gnome-look.org](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1715554).

Create a directory for all your themes at `~/.themes`, 
and move your downloaded folder there.

Now add a symlink from you gtk files (usually located at `~/.config/gtk-4.0`), 
to the respecting files in your themes directory.

There should be a `assets` folder, and `gtk.css`, and `gtk-dark.css` files.

You can create symlinks using the following command (replace 'username'):

```bash title="~/.config/gtk-4.0"
ln -sf /home/username/.themes/Catppuccin-Dark-Macchiato-B-LB/Catppuccin-Dark-Macchiato/gtk-4.0/assets/ ./assets/
```
