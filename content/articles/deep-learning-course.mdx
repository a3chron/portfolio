# Deep Learning / Neural Nets

## Introduction

To be honest, I don't know much about Deep Learning *currently*, 
but I hope to learn much more while writing this course.

If you have problems understanding something, please
[open an Issue](https://github.com/kurtschambach/portfolio/issues/) 
or write me an Email at `kurt.schambach@gmail.com`.
I will try to fix any unclear parts.

Same with spelling mistakes, I have Issue Templates (for the ones that know github, and have an account), 
so you basically just have to fill out a little form.
Also I will add a little link for opening Issues on every site, 
so you wont have to come back here or search for my GitHub to open an Issue ;)

Edit: The buttons on the bottom right are from the top:
- Link to the code
- Link for reporting a Bug or any kind of malfunction (you'll need a GitHub account for that)
- Link for reporting spelling mistakes (Also GitHub account needed)

If you don't have a GitHub account, just write me a small informal Email

**Thank you for helping me improve the Articles!**

## Topics / Content

**In this course, we will - with a few parallel coding examples - 
learn about the basics of Deep Learning and Neural Nets with a focus on different types, e.g. Computer Vision, LLM, etc.**

I will try to add as many examples as possible, because I think that "theory will get you only so far".

As I will (for the beginning i.e. the first few parts) not dive deep into all the types of NNs (we'll only scratch the surface), and also maybe skip some types,
I will add a "Further Reading" section to the end of all bigger blocks with some in my opinion good follow-ups.

The course will be seperated into blocks, and these in little articles.

> Example: The Block "Basics of Neural Networks" is seperated into a few articles, 
> visible in the description: "Basics of Neural Networks 01".
>
> I will try to add a *Content* section to the beginning of all articles, 
> so you can check quick if it's really the article you're searching for.

I recommend reading the whole course in a chronological order, 
especially the articles of one block, because they build up on each other.

You can skip whole topics/blocks, if you are not interested in them (except maybe the Introduction/Basics), 
but some blocks may introduce something new that is important afterwards.

- [x] [Basics of Neural Networks \[01 - ?\]](/blog/neural-network-basics) **- in progress**
- [ ] Computer Vision 1 - Introduction of many Tools we will use, and a first little NN **- in progress**
- [ ] NLP / LLM

... more on the way (I will add any planned and finished blocks here)
