# Deep Learning / Neural Nets

## Introduction

To be honest, I don't know much about Deep Learning *currently*, 
but i hope to learn much more while writing this course.

If you have problems understanding something, please
[open an Issue](https://github.com/kurtschambach/portfolio/issues/) 
or write me an Email at `kurt.schambach@gmail.com`.
I will try to fix any unclear parts.

Same with spelling mistakes, I have Issue Templates (for the ones that know github), 
so you basically just have to fill out a little form.
Also I will add a little link for opening Issues on every site, 
so you wont have to come back here or search for my GitHub to open an Issue ;)

## Topics / Content

In this course, we will - with a few parallel coding examples - 
learn about the basics of Deep Learning and Neural Nets with a focus on different types, e.g. Computer Vision, LLM, etc.

I will try to add as many examples as possible, because I think that "theory will get you only so far"

As I will (for the beginning i.e. the first few parts) not dive deep into all the types of NNs (we'll only scratch the surface), and also maybe skip some types,
I will add a "Further Reading" section to the end of all bigger blocks with some in my opinion good follow-ups.

The course will be seperated into blocks, and these in little parts with one Topic (I will add any planned and finished Blocks here).
I recommend reading them in a chronological order, but you can skip parts if you know the basics.
