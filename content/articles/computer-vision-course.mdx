## Introduction

To be honest, this is just a little summary of a openHPI course, 
but i think, that it's more efficient reading something, than looking videos (as you would have to at openHPI).

Also the openHPI course is in german, so it will be maybe more helpfull in english for some.

As i've said, this is a summary. If you have problems understanding something, 
you can try looking into the [openHPI course](https://open.hpi.de/courses/neuralnets2020).
Another option (i would prefer, to improve this course) is [opening an Issue](https://github.com/kurtschambach/portfolio/issues/) or writing me an Email at `kurt.schambach@gmail.com`.
I will try to fix any unclear parts.

## Topics / Content

This is the first part of a course, that will - with a parallel coding example (at the beginning a little bit more/only theory) - 
give an introduction into Deep Learning and Neuronal Nets, with the focus on Computer Vision.

The course will be seperated into four parts:

1. [Introduction / theory](http://a3chron.vercel.app/blog/computer-vision-1)
2. TODO
3. TODO
4. TODO
