My portfolio website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

I will refactor this soon, don't have the time now, so don't expect the code to be good (but it's working)

## Running Locally

Install dependencies and run the development server:
```sh-session
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

create a .env with the following information:
```
SUPABASE_URL=your-db-url
SUPABASE_API_KEY=your-secret-key
```

or any other DB, but I'm currently using Supabase


## Cloning / Forking
